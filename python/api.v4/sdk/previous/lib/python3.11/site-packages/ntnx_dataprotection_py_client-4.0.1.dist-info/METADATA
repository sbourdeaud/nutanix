## Installation & Usage

### Installing in a virtual environment
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is a tool to create isolated Python environments. The basic problem it addresses is one of dependencies and versions, and indirectly permissions. virtualenv can help you install this client without needing system install permissions. It creates an environment that has its own installation directories without sharing libraries with other virtualenv environments or the system installation.

#### Mac/Linux
To install virtualenv via pip run:
```sh
$ pip3 install virtualenv
```
Create the virtualenv and activate it
```sh
$ virtualenv -p python3 <my-env>
$ source <my-env>/bin/activate
```
Install the Nutanix client into the virtualenv
```sh
<my-env>/bin/pip install ntnx-dataprotection-py-client
```

#### Windows
To install virtualenv via pip run:
```sh
> pip install virtualenv
```
Create the virtualenv and activate it
```sh
> virtualenv <my-env>
> myenv\Scripts\activate
```
Install the Nutanix SDK into the virtualenv
```sh
<your-env>\Scripts\pip.exe install ntnx-dataprotection-py-client
```

Then import the package:
```python
import ntnx_dataprotection_py_client
```

### Sample Configuration
```python
config = Configuration()
config.host = '10.19.50.27' # IPv4/IPv6 address or FQDN of the cluster
config.port = 9440 # Port to which to connect to
config.username = 'admin' # UserName to connect to the cluster
config.password = 'password' # Password to connect to the cluster
api_client = ApiClient(configuration=config)
```

### Proxy Configuration
```python
config = Configuration()
# Configure the cluster as shown previously along with the following proxy configuration
# ...
config.proxy_scheme = "https"
config.proxy_host = "127.0.0.1"
config.proxy_port = 8080
config.proxy_username = "proxy_admin"
config.proxy_password = "proxy_password"
api_client = ApiClient(configuration=config)
```

### mTLS Configuration
```python
config = Configuration()
# Configure the cluster as shown previously along with the following mTLS configuration
# (use path of your own client certificates)
# ...
config.root_ca_certificate_file = "/home/certs/ca.pem"
config.client_certificate_file = "/home/certs/AdonisService/AdonisService.crt"
config.client_key_file = "/home/certs/AdonisService/AdonisService.key"
api_client = ApiClient(configuration=config)
```

### Authentication
Nutanix APIs currently support two type of authentication schemes:

- **HTTP Basic Authentication**
      - The Python client can be configured using the username and password parameters to send Basic headers along with every request.
- **API Key Authentication**
      - The Python client can be configured to set an API key to send "**X-ntnx-api-key**" header with every request.
  ```python
  config = Configuration()
  config.set_api_key('abcde12345')
  api_client = ApiClient(configuration=config)
  ```

### Additional Headers
The python client can be configured to send additional headers on each request.

```python
client = ApiClient(configuration=config)
client.add_default_header(header_name='Accept-Encoding', header_value='gzip, deflate, br')
```

### Retry Mechanism
The client can be configured to retry requests that fail with the following status codes. The numbers of seconds before which the next retry is attempted is determined by the retryInterval:

- [408 - Request Timeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408)
- [429 - Too Many Requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429)
- [502 - Bad Gateway](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/502)
- [503 - Service Unavailable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/503)

The client will also redirect requests that fail with [302 - Found](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/302) to the new location specified in the response header `Location`.
```{backoff factor} * (2 * ({number of retries so far} - 1))```


```python
config = Configuration()
config.max_retry_attempts = 3 # Max retry attempts while reconnecting on a loss of connection
config.backoff_factor = 3 # Backoff factor to use during retry attempts
config.max_redirects = 3 # Max number of redirects to follow
client = ApiClient(configuration=config)
```

## Usage

### Invoking an operation
```python
# Initialize the API
consistency_groups_api_instance = ConsistencyGroupsApi(api_client=client) # client configured in previous step
extId = 'extId_example' # UUID.

# Get details of a consistency group
try:
    api_response = consistency_groups_api_instance.get_consistency_group_by_id(extId)
except ApiException as e:
```

### Setting headers for individual operations
Headers can be configured globally on the python client using the [method to set default headers](#additional-headers). However, sometimes headers need to be set on an individual operation basis. Nutanix APIs require that concurrent updates are protected using [ETag headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag).

```python
# Initialize the API
consistency_groups_api_instance = ConsistencyGroupsApi(api_client=client) # client configured in previous step
extId = 'extId_example' # UUID.

# Get details of a consistency group
try:
    api_response = consistency_groups_api_instance.get_consistency_group_by_id(extId)
except ApiException as e:

# Extract E-Tag Header
etag_value = ApiClient.get_etag(api_response)

# Update a consistency group
try:
    # The body parameter in the following operation is received from the previous GET request's response which needs to be updated.
    api_response = consistency_groups_api_instance.update_consistency_group_by_id(body, extId, if_match=etag_value) # Use the extracted etag value
except ApiException as e:
```

### List Operations
List Operations for Nutanix APIs support pagination, filtering, sorting and projections. The table below details the parameters that can be used to set the options for pagination etc.

| Parameter | Description
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _page     | specifies the page number of the result set. Must be a positive integer between 0 and the maximum number of pages that are available for that resource. Any number out of this range will lead to no results being returned.|
| _limit    | specifies the total number of records returned in the result set. Must be a positive integer between 0 and 100. Any number out of this range will lead to a validation error. If the limit is not provided a default value of 50 records will be returned in the result set|
| _filter   | allows clients to filter a collection of resources. The expression specified with $filter is evaluated for each resource in the collection, and only items where the expression evaluates to true are included in the response. Expression specified with the $filter must conform to the [OData V4.01 URL](https://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part2-url-conventions.html#sec_SystemQueryOptionfilter) conventions. |
| _orderby  | allows clients to specify the sort criteria for the returned list of objects. Resources can be sorted in ascending order using asc or descending order using desc. If asc or desc are not specified the resources will be sorted in ascending order by default. For example, 'orderby=templateName desc' would get all templates sorted by templateName in desc order. |
| _select   | allows clients to request a specific set of properties for each entity or complex type. Expression specified with the $select must conform to the OData V4.01 URL conventions. If a $select expression consists of a single select item that is an asterisk (i.e., *), then all properties on the matching resource will be returned. |
| _expand   | allows clients to request related resources when a resource that satisfies a particular request is retrieved. Each expanded item is evaluated relative to the entity containing the property being expanded. Other query options can be applied to an expanded property by appending a semicolon-separated list of query options, enclosed in parentheses, to the property name. Permissible system query options are $filter,$select and $orderby. |

```python
# Initialize the API
consistency_groups_api_instance = ConsistencyGroupsApi(api_client=client) # client configured in previous step
extId = 'extId_example' # UUID.

# List consistency groups
try:
    api_response = consistency_groups_api_instance.list_consistency_groups(
	                   _page=page, # if page parameter is present
	                   _limit=limit, # if limit parameter is present
	                   _filter=_filter, # if filter parameter is present
	                   _orderby=_orderby, # if orderby parameter is present
	                   _select=select, # if select parameter is present
	                   _expand=expand) # if expand parameter is present
except ApiException as e:

```
